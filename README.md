# simon-game

Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill released in 1978. It was invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, with software programming by Lenny Cope. It was orginially a device that created a series of tones and lights wherein a user would be required to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds in repeating the sequence correctly, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.

This is an online implementation of the Simon Game playable on any web browser.
